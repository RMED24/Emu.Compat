# Emu.Compat
A website for the progress of Emu.compat (can't think of a better name)

This is a work in progress for an upcoming community-ran emulator compatibility list. This is nowhere near ready and subject to lots of change, but the custom database I used requires this to be open source. Also, I needed help from some people on where to take this site and this was the easiest way.

As always, help is appreciated
